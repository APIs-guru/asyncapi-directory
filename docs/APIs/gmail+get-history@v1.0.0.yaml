servers:

    scheme: https
    variables:
      userId:
        description: The user's email address. The special value me can be used to
          indicate the authenticated user.
      historyTypes:
        description: History types to be returned by the function
      labelId:
        description: Only return messages with a label matching the ID.
      maxResults:
        description: The maximum number of history records to return.
      pageToken:
        description: Page token to retrieve a specific page of results in the list.
      startHistoryId:
        description: Required. Returns history records after the specified
          startHistoryId. The supplied startHistoryId should be obtained from
          the historyId of a message, thread, or previous list response. History
          IDs increase chronologically but are not contiguous with random gaps
          in between valid IDs. Supplying an invalid or out of date
          startHistoryId typically returns an HTTP 404 error code. A historyId
          is typically valid for at least a week, but in some rare circumstances
          may be valid for only a few hours. If you receive an HTTP 404 error
          response, your application should perform a full sync. If you receive
          no nextPageToken in the response, there are no updates to retrieve and
          you can store the returned historyId for a future request.

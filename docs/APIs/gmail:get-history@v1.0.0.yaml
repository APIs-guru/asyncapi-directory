      startHistoryId:

          Required. Returns history records after the specified startHistoryId.
          The supplied startHistoryId should be obtained from the historyId of a
          message, thread, or previous list response. History IDs increase
          chronologically but are not contiguous with random gaps in between
          valid IDs. Supplying an invalid or out of date startHistoryId
          typically returns an HTTP 404 error code. A historyId is typically
          valid for at least a week, but in some rare circumstances may be valid
          for only a few hours. If you receive an HTTP 404 error response, your
          application should perform a full sync. If you receive no
          nextPageToken in the response, there are no updates to retrieve and
          you can store the returned historyId for a future request.

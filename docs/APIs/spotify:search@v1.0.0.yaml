          The search query's keywords (and optional field filters). The search
          is not case-sensitive: 'roadhouse' will match 'Roadhouse',
          'roadHouse', etc. Keywords will be matched in any order unless
          surrounded by quotes, thus q=roadhouse&20blues will match both 'Blues
          Roadhouse' and 'Roadhouse of the Blues'. Quotation marks can be used
          to limit the match to a phrase: q=roadhouse&20blues will match 'My
          Roadhouse Blues' but not 'Roadhouse of the Blues'. By default, results
          are returned when a match is found in any field of the target object
          type. Searches can be made more specific by specifying an album,
          artist or track field filter. For example
          q=album:gold%20artist:abba&type=album will search for albums with the
          text 'gold' in the album name and the text 'abba' in an artist name.
          Other possible field filters, depending on object types being
          searched, include year, genre, upc, and isrc. For example,
          q=damian%20genre:reggae-pop&type=artist. The asterisk (*) character
          can, with some limitations, be used as a wildcard (maximum: 2 per
          query). It will match a variable number of non-white-space characters.
          It cannot be used in a quoted phrase, in a field filter, or as the
          first character of the keyword string. Searching for playlists will
          return results matching the playlist's name and/or description.
      type:
        description: >-
          A comma-separated list of item types to search across. Search results
          will include hits from all the specified item types; for example
          q=name:abacab&type=album,track will return both albums and tracks with
          "abacab" in their name.
      market:
        description: >-
          The market (an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code).  If given, only items
          with content playable in that market will be returned.

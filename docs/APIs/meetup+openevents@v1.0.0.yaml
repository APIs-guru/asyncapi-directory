          waitlist_count, group, visibility, timezone. Value must be true or

      text:
        description: Events that contain the given term or terms somewhere in their
          content. The terms are OR'd by default. Separate terms with " AND "
          for events that have combined terms. To have terms automatically
          AND'd, set the "and_text" to true

          specified with relative dates, such as "1m" for one month from now, or
          by absolute time in milliseconds since the epoch. If an endpoint is
          omitted, the range is unbounded on that end. The default value is
          unbounded on both ends (though restricted to the search window
          described above). Note: to retrieve past events you must also update
          status value'

          milliseconds since the epoch

          Order in which comments were returned.

          reverse_chronological: Comments sorted by the newest comments first.
      total_count:
        description: >-
          The count of comments on this node. It is important to note that this
          value is changed depending on the filter modifier being used (where
          comment replies are available):


          if filter is stream then total_count will be a count of all comments (including replies) on the node.

          if filter is toplevel then total_count will be a count of all top-level comments on the node.

          Note: total_count can be greater than or equal to the actual number of comments returned due to comment privacy or deletion.

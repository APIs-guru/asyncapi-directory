# About AsyncAPI-Directory and APIs.guru

Our goal is to create the most comprehensive, standards-compliant and up-to-date directory of machine-readable [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.org/) definitions with the following principles:
- Open source, community driven project.
- Only publicly available APIs (free or paid).
- Anyone can add or change an API, not only API owners.
- All data can be accessed through a simple REST API returning JSON.
